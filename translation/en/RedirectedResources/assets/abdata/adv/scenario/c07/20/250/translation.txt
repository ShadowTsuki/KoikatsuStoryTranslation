「一日がもっと長ければ、もっともっとたくさんお前と遊べるのになー、何で２４時間なんだ」=We'd be able to play around together for a lot longer too, if the day was just a bit longer. Why are there only 24 hours in a day?
「２４時間じゃ足りない？」=Are 24 hours not enough?
「全然だね。私はまだまだやりたいこと、たくさんあるからな！」=Not even close. There's absolutely tons of stuff that I still wanna do with you!
「ははっ、すごい元気だなぁ」=Haha--, aren't you energetic?
