「内装も凝った感じでオシャレだなぁ、この店」=Man, this store's interior's so refined and fashionable.
「まあでも、それに負けないくらい[H名]もオシャレだよね」=But, you're much more fashionable than this store could ever be, [H名].
「そ、そうか？　まあ、似合わないだろうけどさ、好きなんだ、ファッションとか」=T-That so? Well, I'm sure these clothes don't look all that good on me, but I like dressing according to fashion and stuff.
「いやすごく似合ってると思うよ。かっこいい感じでさ」=No, you really do look good in them. Super cool.
「ん……ありがと。そういう[P名]はどうなんだよ。オシャレとかは……しなさそうだな～」=Mm... thanks. What about you though, [P名]. It doesn't really seem like... you care about fashion at all~
「う……ま、まあそうかも……服とかあんまりわかんないんだよね」=Urgh... W-Well, you're not wrong... I don't really know all that much about clothes and stuff.
「そうだ、今度私が[P名]の服を見繕ってやるよ」=Well then, how about we go shopping together sometime, and I'll pick out some clothes for you?
「ホント？　それはありがたいな～」=For real? That'd be a life saver~
「ああ。そのかわり、どんな服でも絶対着るんだぞ。文句言ったらただじゃおかないからな」=Yeah. In return, you have to wear them, no matter what. If you whinge about it, I won't let you go, got it?
「え、なんでニヤニヤしてるの？　めっちゃ不安になってきたんだけど……」=Eh, why are you saying that with such a shit-eating grin? I'm starting to get really worried now...
「くっくっく……楽しみにしとけよ」=Kukukuh... Look forward to it.
「[H名]はオシャレとか、興味ないの？」=Do you have no interest in things like fashion, [H名]?
「うーん、あんまし……。私が着飾ったって、どうせ似合いやしないさ」=Well, not all that much, no... Even if I were to doll myself up, I wouldn't look all that good to begin with.
「そんなことないよ。スタイルいいし、なんでも着こなせると思うけどなー」=That's not true at all. You've got great style, I think you could pull off just about anything.
「ワインレッドのイブニングドレスとか……いや、いっそのこと濃紺のゴスロリなんてのも……」=Like a wine red evening dress... no, I'd much rather see you in a blue goth loli dress instead...
「[P名]……私を着せ替え人形にして遊ぼうとしてるだろ？」=[P名]... You're thinking of playing dress-up doll with me, aren't you?
「いやいや、違うって。いろんな格好の[H名]も見てみたいなって思ってさ」=Nope, not at all. I was just thinking that maybe I'd like to see all the different sides you have, [H名]
「また調子いいこと言って。でもまあ……[P名]が望むんなら、ちっとくらいしてやってもいいぞ、オシャレ」=Always with those buttered words. But well... if that's what you want, [P名], I don't mind going along with it, just a bit.
「ホント？　じゃあ、今度一緒に洋服買いに行こうか！」=Really? Then, let's go clothes shopping one of these days!
「いいけど……あっ、ニヤニヤしやがって！　やっぱり変な服着せて遊ぶつもりだろー！」=Sure but... ah--, always with those shit-eating grins! Just like I thought, you just wanna play dress up doll with me, don't you!
「ち、違うってば！」=N-Not at all, I told you!
