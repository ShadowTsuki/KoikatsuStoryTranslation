「今日の練習はこれで終わり！　気を付け、礼！」=That's all for today's practice! Attention, bow!
今日も部長の役割を練習する水瀬さんの号令が響く。=Ai's orders rang out as she practised her role as club president again today.
「よし、行くか」=Okay, let's go.
隅で見学していた俺は、覚悟を決めるように宣言すると、後片付けの手伝いに向かう。=After watching from the corner, I decided that it was time and went to help with the clean up.
（今日こそは返事をしないとな……）=(I'll have to get back to her today...)
「よっと」=Ooph.
「お、力持ち～」=Oh, you're so strong~
「よいしょよいしょ」=Heave ho, heave ho.
「私も負けないぞ～」=I'm not going to let you beat me~
軽口を叩き合いながらも、どこかでお互い意識してる。=We talk casually to each other, but we're each very focussed on the other.
水瀬さんが笑うたびに無理をしてることが伝わってきて、早く返事をしてあげないとと心が急く。=Every time Ai smiled, I could tell she was forcing herself, and my mind raced to answer her quickly.
（今日こそ、言えるか……？）=(Is today the day I tell her...?)
俺は、自分の心に問いかける。=I keep asking myself the same question.
CHOICE:ＯＫする=Okay, I'll do it.
CHOICE:保留にする=I'll hold off for now.

亜依=Ai
